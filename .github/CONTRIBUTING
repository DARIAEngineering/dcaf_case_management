## How to be an awesome contributor to this project

### Are you submitting a pull request?

* Try to fix one thing per pull request! Many people bang on this code, so the more focused your changes are, the less of a headache other people will have when they merge their work in. 
* If you're stuck, ask the slack channel! There are a number of experienced programmers who are happy to help with learning and troubleshooting.

### Are you new and looking to dive in?

* Check the `beginner friendly` tag for issues that don't require deep familiarity with the codebase.
* Check out the README! We do a pretty good job of documenting our processes. 
* Come hang out with us at a Code for DC meeting!
