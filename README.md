## Project description
This project is a case management system for the [DC Abortion Fund](http://dcabortionfund.org/) (DCAF), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that gives grants to people in DC, Maryland, and Virginia who cannot afford the full cost of abortion care.

Before this app went into production at DCAF, a team of 75 case managers were inputting around 3,500 calls a year into shared Excel sheets. This app replaced that with a nice, clean, useable and shareable rails system that ditches spreadsheets forever! This will let DCAF and other funds continue to operate at a fast pace, and prevent volunteers from getting frustrated with shared Excel sheets. In addition, other abortion funds doing similar work in other places have adopted this system for their use.

Get started with the how-and-why of the project by [checking out DCAF](http://dcabortionfund.org), checking out [DCAF Case Manager Lisa's explanation of DCAF's business logic](docs/DCAF_101.md), reading the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and reading the `#dcaf_case_management` [channel on Slack](https://codefordc.slack.com/messages/dcaf_case_management/files). You can also check out [some of the other buzz](docs/PRESS.md).

### Setting Stuff Up

[We have detailed instructions on how to get started here!](docs/SETUP.md)

If you have any trouble getting things set up, please ping us in Slack!

If you see a spot in the docs that's confusing or could be improved, please pay it forward by making a pull request!

### We <3 new people and beginners!
We recognize that not everyone comes to this project intimately familiar with rails. **If you've got the time and energy to contribute, we've got the time to help guide you in the right direction and make sure your time is well spent.** We've also got a set of issues that [are good starting points](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22) if you're fresh to this project.

We've tried to structure the project in such a way that minimal specialized knowledge is required to contribute; we use the default Rails stack wherever possible, with the exception of MongoDB and a couple gems.

**We prioritize inclusivity of all skill levels on this project** -- in general, if you are willing to put in the time to learn, a team member will be willing to work with you to make it happen!

### Pull Requests Please!
This project runs on *Github forks and pull requests*, so we can be sure to make changes incrementally and keep everything clean. For an introduction to Github, check out [this guide on github.com](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

Here's how you do it:

* Visit [the main project page](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management) and fork from the master branch by pressing the `fork` button near the top right.
* Do any work in your local environment and commit it to your fork in github.
* Once you have finished your changes and have confirmed they're all working, make a pull request by pressing the Pull Request button.
* At least one other person will review and comment on code changes, work with you to resolve issues, and merge the pull request when it's ready.

### How We Categorize Our To Do List / Issues

As noted above, this project maintains a [list of issues in Github](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues) that make up our To-Do List. We generally categorize things as follows:

Our major categories of software development related issues are as follows:
* [Beginner Friendly](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22) (Issues which require minimal familiarity with our codebase to complete, *reserved for people making their first contribution to this project*)
* [Frontend](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afrontend) (Rails view work, CSS/JS work)
* [Backend](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abackend) (Rails controller and model work)
* [Minitest](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aminitest) (Feature and unit test work)
* [Bug](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) (Something deployed that isn't working as intended!)
* [UX/Design](https://github.com/colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AUX%2Fdesign) (Design todos, or stuff that could use some feedback)

We also keep track of our administrative issues and discussion in Github under the following issue labels:
* [Admin](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aadmin) (Readme stuff, project organizing matters, etc)
* [Question](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquestion) (Issues that require a little more discussion before we settle on a plan of attack)
* [Backlog](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abacklog) (Low priority stuff that we'll get around to someday)
