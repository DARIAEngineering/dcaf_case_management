# Accounting tools

DARIA offers an accounting workflow for easier reconciliation. This resource is limited to Data Volunteer and Admin users, and is located under Admin > Accounting.

This workflow shows patients on all lines who have been marked as Pledge Sent. You can mark them as Fulfilled (e.g. mark that the clinic cashed the pledge for that patient) by searching for the patient, clicking the pen icon, and then entering the Fulfillment information for that patient.

We offer the Audited? checkbox to note that a second set of eyes has verified things. (Audited records are destroyed in DARIA in our nightly cleanup process.)
