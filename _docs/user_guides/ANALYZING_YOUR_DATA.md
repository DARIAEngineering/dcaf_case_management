# Analyzing DARIA Data

We provide an anonymized CSV export so you can learn more about your program, report back to stakeholders, or whatever else.

In keeping with our security practices, we intentionally limit identifiable information exported. This is to make sure that data leaks don't include names, phone numbers, etc. In other words, some information that is less useful for analysis but still useful for case managing doesn't make it out.

## Running the export

This export is accessible to anyone with the permission level of Admin or Data Volunteer.

You can pull the export by logging in to DARIA, looking for the Admin dropdown, and then clicking Export Anonymized CSV. You can then do further analysis in Excel, Python, or whatever your favored utility is.
