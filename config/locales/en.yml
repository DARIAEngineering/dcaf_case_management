    call_list: This sortable list is used to keep track of patients to call back during your shift. Use the search to populate it.
    completed_calls: This is a list of patients you have called within the last 8 hours.
    mandatory_ultrasound: If you are in a state that requires ultrasounds and the patient has completed one, you can log it here.
    record_new_external_pledge: External pledges is our term for pledges by other abortion funds also working with a patient.
