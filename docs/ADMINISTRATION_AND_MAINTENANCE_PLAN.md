# Our maintenance plan

This roadmap outlines responsibilities for administration of funds in the DCAF-administered Heroku pipeline (e.g. where DCAF administers DARIA for them, hence referred to as our `pipeline`), and roadmapping new development.

## Administration

* The engineering team has set up a series of monitors for applications within our pipeline, and is responsible for keeping an eye on them and troubleshooting when something goes wrong.
* The engineering team is responsible for applying security fixes and other regular maintenance.
* The DCAF case management team is responsible for communicating support requests to the engineers in the [slack channel](https://codefordc.slack.com/messages/dcaf_case_management).
* We can allow fund stakeholders access to management of the application so they can restart it if they like; funds should reach out to the engineering team or DARIA project lead if they're interested.

## Developing new features

* Every once in awhile (probably six to nine months), the DARIA project lead and DCAF data board member will poll DCAF and other member funds and see what development priorities or pain points have popped up, and select one or two priorities to work on.
* When this happens, the DARIA project lead is responsible for assembling engineers and pushing it through.
* A core team of engineers will continue to review pull requests.

## Getting new funds on DARIA

* The (relatively easy!) instructions for setting up new instances are [here](https://github.com/DCAFEngineering/dcaf_case_management/blob/main/docs/SETTING_UP_A_NEW_INSTANCE.md#by-the-way)
* New funds interested in adopting DARIA will be pointed toward the DARIA project lead, who will work with them to figure out whether or not this software is a good fit.
* The DARIA project lead will serve as a liaison between the board, engineering team, and the new fund.
