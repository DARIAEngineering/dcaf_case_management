# Data Fields in DARIA
This is a basic data dictionary of every field collected by DARIA.

* **Patient Reported** are fields that a patient will communicate to the case manager. These fields are often unverifiable but often do not have any impact on ability to fund, depending on which Fund is using DARIA.
* **CM Reported** are field that are generated by the case manager themselves and can be verified by the Fund. 
* **Autogenerated** are fields that are generated by DARIA and are triggered by an action from the case manager.
