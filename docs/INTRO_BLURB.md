# An intro blurb to DARIA

## The blurb

DARIA is software for abortion funds by abortion funders, and friends of abortion funders. The DC Abortion Fund used to do case management out of a spreadsheet, and found that it was hard to focus on conversations with people seeking abortion care when fighting with Excel. So a team of abortion fund volunteers, engineers, and designers came up with DARIA as a way for abortion fund volunteers to keep tabs on important information without the limitations and difficulties of spreadsheets. DARIA went into service at DCAF in July 2016, and in Feb 2022, it became an independent non-profit. DARIA now used by 10+ abortion funds around the US.

It's an open source application deployed to Heroku, where funds can use it as a regular SaaS product. Our product decisions are made by a leadership team working together, and things we want to do are turned into Github Issues, which serve as the project's to-do list.

All told, we've found that contributing to DARIA is a great way to leverage engineering and design skills to help abortion funds work, and by extension assist people seeking abortion care who are in a real tight spot.

* Join the code for DC slack here: https://codefordc.org/slack (we're in the channel #dcaf_case_management, and tend to be pretty responsive)
* Stack-wise: It's a Rails application that mostly hews to rails defaults wherever possible. We have a docker build if you'd rather not deal with installing stuff. There's relatively little fancy stuff in it. More particular directions are in the README.

We look forward to having you!
