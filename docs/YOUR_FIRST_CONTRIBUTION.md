# Making your first contribution

If you're new to the project, a great first contribution is to [add a nice message for our case managers](https://github.com/DARIAEngineering/dcaf_case_management/issues/884). Our case managers see these messages on login, so it's a great opportunity to show some appreciation for the hard work they're doing.

To do so, follow the following instructions:

* Set up the app per instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
* Open up `app/helpers/welcome_message_helper.rb`
* Add a nice message to the end of the array in `welcome_messages`
* Commit your change
* Pull request your change, referencing issue #884 in the description of your changes
