# Working out contract agreements

When we administer a DARIA instance for a fund, we ask them to sign an agreement. The gist of the agreement is "you just have to pay for your share of the server bill, you own your data and the DARIA team can only access it when troubleshooting, and please don't sue us".

## Steps to getting the contract worked out

* Make a copy of FUND TEMPLATE in the Google Drive, in the Services Agreements folder. Ask @colinxfleming if you're having trouble finding.
* Find and replace the shortnames, longnames, and signature blocks. Note that you'll need to know what
* Set the effective-at date to the first of the next month.
* Get @colinxfleming, @lomky or @lwaldsc to sign on the DARIA side.
* Send the signed-by-DARIA copy of the contract to the point person(s) for the fund.
  * Ask them to review, sign, and send it back. (This is uncommon, but if they object to parts of it, loop in the DARIA lead to help resolve.)
* Once contract is in hand, put the contract in the Services Agreement folder with the other contracts and let the leads know.
