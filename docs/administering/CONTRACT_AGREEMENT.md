# Working out contract agreements

When we administer a DARIA instance for a fund, we ask them to sign an agreement. The gist of the agreement is "you just have to pay for your share of the server bill, you own your data and the DARIA team can only access it when troubleshooting, and please don't sue us".

## Steps to getting the contract worked out

* Find the contract template in the DCAF resources. Ask the DARIA lead at DCAF or the board Treasurer for a copy if you don't have it handy.
* Do some find-and-replace for the name of the abortion funds.
* Send it to the DARIA lead for spot-checking and their signature.
* Send the signed-by-DCAF copy of the contract to the point person(s) for the fund. Ask them for the following.
  * Ask them to review, sign, and send it back. (This is uncommon, but if they object to parts of it, loop in the DARIA lead to help resolve.)
  * Ask them who the point of contact for the fund should be, and what their billing address is.
* Once contract is in hand, let the DARIA lead know; put the contract in the DCAF drive with the other shared contracts.
* Notify the board Treasurer and the DARIA lead that we have a signed copy in hand; let them know the point person and their billing address for invoicing as well.
