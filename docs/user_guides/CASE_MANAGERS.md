# Using DARIA as a Case Manager

The main point of DARIA is to ensure case managers can focus on conversation with patients, rather than fighting with computers. DARIA's aim is to ensure case managers don't need to sweat the small stuff, and to organize patient information consistently.

Case managers will spend most of their time on the `Call List page` and the `Patient Record page`. This document will go through those views and what they're used for.

## The call list page

When you log in and pick your line, and see a header of `Build your call list`, you are on the `Call List page`. This is where you can plan your work for the evening, make a list of people to call, log any new callers, and keep tabs on who you've called.

### Build your call list

You use this tool to populate your call list for the day. Entering either a phone number, part of a phone number, or a name will search patients for a match and return any matches it finds that aren't already in your call list. You can add people to your call list by clicking the `Add` link after searching for them.

Generally your shift will start by using this tool to find everyone you need to call that day, and then adding people as necessary, but you can use it for single patient lookups as well.

Your call list is unique to you as a case manager, and other case managers can't see what patients you have on your list.

#### Creating a new patient

If a search doesn't find any results, instead of a list of patients, DARIA will show a new form to create a new patient case file. Once you save this form, the patient is in DARIA, and you can add the patient to your call list.

DARIA won't let you save a patient unless the phone number is unique. Refer to your fund on guidance for how to handle duplicate phone numbers.

### Your call list / Completed calls

This is a rollup of patients that you intend to call. It contains names, phone numbers, and some other additional information.

You can log a call to a patient by clicking the phone icon on the far right, which will open a pop-up with some additional information. Generally, you'll do this as follows:

* Click the phone icon on the right side to pop up the additional information
* Dial your phone to make the call
* If the patient picks up and you start a conversation with them, click the `I reached the patient` button; this will redirect you to their `Patient Record page`. Otherwise, if you leave a voicemail or it just rings, you can click the appropriate link to return to your call list.
* Either action will shift them to the `Completed Calls` section.

You can remove patients from your call list by clicking the red X icon. Your call list will automatically empty out after two weeks of not logging in.

You can click the patient's name to go straight to their `Patient Record page`.

### Urgent cases

There is a way to flag patients so that they are easier for others to find. This section is where they show up. This is shared across everyone who logs in on the line.

To mark a patient urgent, look in the `Patient Record page` under `Notes`.

Patients automatically filter out of this section after a week of not being updated, or if they're marked resolved, or if a pledge is sent for them to a clinic.

### Line Activity Log

To make it easier to see who the previous case manager was communicating with, we have the `Line Activity Log`. DARIA keeps track of every call and pledge in the last three weeks, and displays them in this section for a given line.

You can use this section to add particular patients to your call list, or click into their patient records.

## The patient record page

One of DARIA's major strengths is consistent organization of information. Our team has worked hard to present information about particular patients in ways that are easy to sort. This information is associated with a patient, and shows up the same for every case manager.

Your fund will have guidance on what data to collect specifically.

### Entering information about a patient

Most fields on this page detect changes automatically, and autosave. (Logging notes, external pledges, and practical support requires pressing a button.)

### Sending (or unsending) a pledge

To send a pledge, click the button on the left sidebar. This will open a pop-up with information about the patient for you to confirm.

If DARIA has all the information it needs, click next to go to the next screen. At a minimum, DARIA needs a clinic, appointment date, and amount of money to mark a pledge.

DARIA will now prompt you to send the pledge to the clinic. Note that DARIA does not automatically send pledges to clinics. Ask your fund for guidance on how to send pledges.

Finally, click next again, and check the box to indicate that you sent the pledge.

If changes are needed, you can withdraw the pledge in DARIA by clicking the `Cancel pledge` button, then `Next`, and uncheck the box. Ask your fund for guidance on contacting the clinic to inform them of any changes to a pledge that was already sent.
