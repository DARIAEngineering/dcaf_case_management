# Configuring your list of clinics

Clinics are how DARIA talks about abortion providers. These can be independent providers, hospitals, Planned Parenthood affiliates, etc.

Case managers need clinics to be able to use DARIA; they need to be able to mark down where they're sending money. Keeping clinic information up to date is very much appreciated by your case managers!

To access your clinic panel, click the `Admin` dropdown and select `Clinic Management`. You must be an admin to do any of this.

## Adding clinics

Adding a new clinic will make it available for case managers, who need to select a clinic to send a pledge out. You can do this by clicking the `Add a new clinic` button, filling out the form, and clicking the `Add clinic` button at the bottom.

## Updating clinic information

To update or change clinic information, click the clinic's name. Make your changes and click `Save changes`. This will take effect immediately across your entire app, including past patients.

## Removing clinics from your rotation

If you are no longer working with a clinic, you can uncheck the `Are we actively working with this clinic?` box. This will put the clinic in a separate location. (We can't delete clinics; patients who have come through previously may still need to reference that clinic. If you _really_ need to remove a clinic from your instance entirely, reach out to the DARIA team.)

## The data we track and why

Generally, case managers interact with the list of clinics by selecting the name from a dropdown. In other words, they generally can't see a clinic's address/phone/fax when doing their work. You will likely want to store that in a different reference document for your case managers.

Case managers have a few tools available to them to help them figure out what clinic will be best for a ptient. The `Accepts NAF` and `Accepts Medicaid` checkboxes will help case managers identify these clinics on the fly.

Case managers also have a lookup tool that helps them identify the closest and most affordable clinic to a patient based on zipcode. The fields on the right-hand column when looking at a clinic, such as `Gestational limit (in days)` and `Costs` fields, are used by this tool. You don't need to fill out or maintain these fields, but it helps!
