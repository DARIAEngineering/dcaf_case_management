# Configuring your DARIA instance

Your DARIA instance is just for your fund, and you can configure things how you like to meet your fund's processes. We make a variety of settings available so you can customize the information your case managers can work with.

You can access your config panel by clicking the `Admin` dropdown, and clicking on `Config Management`. You must be an admin user to change these settings.

## Changing your DARIA configuration

To change a configuration, fill in the form input and click the `Save` button beneath that input. This takes effect immediately for all users.

## Adding new lines

Many funds accommodate an increase in volume by funneling calls into different hotlines. DARIA accounts for this by having a concept of a `line`, and keeping patients within that Line. For example, the DC Abortion Fund has a line for DC callers, a line for MD callers, a line for VA callers, and a line for Spanish speakers.

Adding or removing lines is a setting that engineers need to change for you; to add, contract, or rename lines in your DARIA, reach out to the DARIA team.
