# Glossary of DARIA terms

These are quick explanations of concepts or specialized terms in DARIA.

## Lines

Some funds divide their operations into multiple funnels, which we call lines. DCAF, for example, sorts callers into _lines_ of DC, MD, VA, and Spanish, so that case managers don't get overwhelmed and work is divided up more equally. (Email the DARIA team if you want your DARIA instance to get a new line.)

## Flagged cases

Case managers can flag particular patients, which will pull them into their own section on the call list page. Generally, this is to facilitate easier case manager handoff, though your fund may use it in a slightly different way.

Patients are automatically removed from this section if six days goes by without their information being changed, or if they're marked as resolved without fund assistance, or if they're marked as pledge sent.

## External pledges

This is DARIA's term for other abortion funds or institutions who are contributing to a particular case. For example, if I am a case manager for the Baltimore Abortion Fund, and Women's Medical Fund has agreed to contribute $50, Women's Medical Fund is contributing an External Pledge.

## Practical support

This is how DARIA keeps tabs on logistical assistance funds may provide in the course of getting a patient to their abortion. For example, a bus ticket or a cab ride fall under practical support.

## Pledge fulfillment

When a clinic sends a remittance to indicate that a patient showed up to their appointment and used their pledge, DARIA expects you to enter that as a fulfillment.

## Auditing

When a fund team member has reviewed a record to confirm its accuracy, they can mark it `Fulfillment audited`. This will archive the record and delete personally identifiable information for the record shortly.

## Archiving

DARIA has a number of processes to remove personally identifiable information from patients when a fund indicates they no longer need it. This process removes name, phone number, and some other information, such that it reduces a patient to what's in the CSV export.
