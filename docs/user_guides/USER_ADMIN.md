# Managing your DARIA users

Users are how DARIA represents a case manager, fund staff member, or anyone else who requires access to a fund's intake system.

DARIA admins can access the user management panel by clicking the `Admin` dropdown and selecting `User Management`.

## A reminder about the public DARIA sandbox

An FYI: we don't recommend you train new case managers on your instance, unless they're going to be in your case rotation with everyone. If you need to conduct a training before someone takes a shift, please feel free to use the [public DARIA sandbox](https://sandbox.dcabortionfund.org) instead. (Don't save any real patient data there; it's public!)

## Creating an account

To create a new account for someone, click the `Add New User` button and fill out their name and email. This creates a Case Manager account for them. To change their permission level (such as to make them an admin), follow the `Changing someone's permissions` directions.

## Removing someone's access

To shut off someone's account, click the `Lock account` button by their name. This prevents them from logging in. You can click the `Unlock account` button to restore their access.

DARIA will automatically lock someone's account if they haven't used DARIA in 9 months. This is to prevent old volunteers from having open accounts, since that's a security risk. You can easily turn their accounts back on by clicking the `Unlock account` button.

## Changing someone's permissions

To change someone's permissions, click on their name; look for `Update this user's role and permissions` and click the appropriate button.

### Permission levels in DARIA

DARIA has permissions set at three levels:

* `Case managers`, who have access to patients and the call list;
* `Data volunteers`, who have access to patients, the call list, the accounting panel, and can export data to a CSV;
* and `Admins`, who have access to all of DARIA's features, including the ability to create more users.

Generally, you want to have as few admins in DARIA as possible; this should be only trusted team members or staff.
